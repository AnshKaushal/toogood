Its a basic answer but it&#39;s true in whole aspects. Let&#39;s take a scenerio, where we tell the computer that &quot;bro,&nbsp;you have to do this task for me&quot; and it&#39;ll reply &quot;100010100010111110&quot; and surely we&#39;ll not understand what it is saying. Actually computer has its own language ie, binary. We can communicate with it using binary digits, but since we don&#39;t know how to communicate in binary, here comes our savior, Programming languages.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><span style=\"font-size:22px\">So what does programming language do ?</span></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">ans : When we are unable to communicate to the computer in binary digits, programming language come to save us. We can tell the computer through different programming languages, what we want to say and the computer will then understand it and we can then see the output.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><span style=\"font-size:22px\">Different types of programming languages :</span></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">&gt; There are over 300 types of programming languages that exist as of 2022. Main languages include : C, C++, HTML, Css, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Flutter etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">Most of them are easy to understand and learn, but some can be really tricky when it comes to learning! If you ever think that &quot;xyz&quot; language is not understandable, just refer to Google. I know it&#39;s cheating, but no one is perfect in this world, So don&#39;t worry about refering to google, even the best of developers also use google to refer to something. So why can&#39;t you ?ðŸ˜‰.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">That&#39;s it guys, for this post.

But we&#39;re gonna count only the helpful and important ones.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:22px\">1. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">Among our list of web development trends, the PWA technology comes first. It&rsquo;s an app that functions as a website with a full-native mobile app experience. It communicates with clients as a native app and runs independently. It can be really handy when you have to test both mobile based and web based applications.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>2. Single Page Application (SPA)</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">SPA is one of the trendy and ruling web development technologies. Unlike conventional website apps, they contain a single page that initially loads the whole website page and then loads the dynamic content on the same page. HTML5 and AJAX are used to make SPAs responsive. These websites are based either on React.js framework or Nuxt js.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>3. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">It is one more trend in the web development industry. The concept of AMP is to accelerate page functionality and retain users. AMP technology works quite similarly to PWA. AMPs are optimized pages that feature a convenient and simplified design with basic features compared to full-scope web products. Moreover, these pages are mobile-responsive, and their content is also readable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:22px\">4. AI-Powered Chatbots</span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">In 2022 and beyond, we expect AI-enabled chatbots to become even more versatile in fulfilling the requirements of matching user behaviors by using natural language processing, machine learning, and data retrieval methods. AI-powered chatbots also enhance the client experience. They can accumulate information, fix problems, answer promptly to queries, and all in all, offer a smooth digital experience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>5. Serverless Architecture</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindinventory.com/cloud-computing-solutions.php\">cloud SaaS solutions</a>&nbsp;have maximized this year because of the establishment of work-from-home shifts. Being one of the quickly growing domains, the Web documented a massive increase in the popularity of serverless architecture.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">According to the State of the Cloud Report by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.flexera.com/web/pdf/report-cm-state-of-the-cloud-2021.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flexera</a>, 99% of companies utilize at least one private or public cloud. It shows that cloud architecture is going to be a significant future web development trend.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>6. Motion UI</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">Creative web design is another web development trend this year. Startups always focus more on user experience and invest fewer resources in appearance. However, there are more chance of getting notice by promising users if you have a beautifully designed apps and websites. Hence, visual design has become an effective marketing strategy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:22px\">7. Mobile-First Development</span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">The rapid increase of mobile users describes why the mobile-first method will massively shape the future of web development. Many web developers have been using this method for years. As per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/306528/share-of-mobile-internet-traffic-in-global-regions/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a>, mobile devices covered more than 57% of webpage views globally in August 2021. Since mobile devices are getting the maximum traffic, using the mobile-first web development approach has become crucial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong>8. Blockchain Technology</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">The concept of cryptocurrencies appeared in 2004, and we must expect a lot from this web development technology in 2022 and onwards. Globally, there are almost&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">80 million</a>&nbsp;blockchain wallet users at the end of Nov 2021. Blockchain technology also needs software and hardware support, trading infrastructure, and legal regulation. Hence, growing web technologies will cover these features in the upcoming years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size:22px\">Bottom Lines</span></strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">The web development trends discussed above will change how businesses communicate with their clients in 2022 and onwards. Using these technologies will enhance user engagement and help your business stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\">That&#39;s it guys, for this post.
